# Files

You can have two files per-project. They will be created as subfolders of this
folder using the same name as your repos folder name.

Your project folder will be mapped as sites/default/files.

A second folder may be created called project_leacy if you are using migrate in
your project.

You can create the project files folder using "./deploy project new".
