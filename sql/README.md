# SQL

You can place your databases here. They should be named:

project.sql.gz
project_legacy.sql.gz # used for migrations

Yes, they must be gzipped.

You can import the DB wth the command "./deploy project db"

For Drupal 8 sites you may want to install the site first before importing. Use
"./deploy project si" to do that with the standard profile, then run the DB
command above."
