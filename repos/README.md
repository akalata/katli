# Repos

You will clone your sites here. You can clone from git, svn, cvs... nobody
cares what you are using.

Just make sure you name the subfolder something nice, as it will be the first
parameter each time you run the ./deploy command.

Databases, files folders, settings files... are all based on this name.

You can create this subfolder by typing "./deploy project new" where project is
the name of your project.
